- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in programs, sports, and music.
- ðŸŒ± I am self-taught [cs course](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).
-  I am falling in love with Kubernetes.

Every 12 years is a round for me to be reborn. At the age of 24, I had a job as a programmer, and at the age of 36, I realized how to become a true programmer. At 40 I want to be not too old to be a developer.

**BETTER LATE THAN NEVER**

**WORK SMART, NOT WORK HARD**
