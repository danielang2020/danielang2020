- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in program, sport and music.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [cs course](https://teachyourselfcs.com/).

Every 12 years is a round for me to be reborn. At the age of 24, I had a job as a programmer, at the age of 36, I realized how to become a true programmer.

**BETTER LATE THAN NEVER**

**WORK SMART, NOT WORK HARD**
